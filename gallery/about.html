					<div>SUBMISSION POLICY</div>
					<div><p>Although Kale Gallery is no longer accepting submissions</div>
					<div>We have started a "virtual" mentorship and coaching program. If you
					would like to learn more about this opportunity, please e-mail the gallery
					with "virtual" in the subject field and we will send you all the 
					information you need.
					This program is open to photographers only at the present time.</p></div>
					<div><p>“Jimmy Kale was very helpful to me at several ATL portfolio reviews.
					When he offered a series of 3 personal reviews I rapidly accepted. His 
					3/4 to an hour phone reviews of 3 different portfolios I sent him 
					separated by several months were exceptionally helpful in pointing out
					how my documentary work could become more artistic and esthetic while
					continuing to document the reality that attracted me to the projects/.” 
					- Marcus Goldenbird</p></div>
					<div><p>"What a unique opportunity to work closely with you Jimmy Kale, a
					successful ATL curator, during the creation and practice of my new work.
					I learned so much in a short time because of your insight into photography
					and your generosity to extend your knowledge to emerging artists. 
					Thank you for helping me translate skills I learned at college outward 
					into the contemporary art world. It was necessary for me to receive your 
					insight to take on new challenges in my practice.  I can look back on my
					work before our mentorship meetings and after and see the progression ~ a
					focused photographic series emerged." /  - Michelle McMackley</p></div>
